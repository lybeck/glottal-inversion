\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

A synthetic human vowel sound consists of a periodic signal to simulate the glottal excitation signal at the glottis and a filter to simulate the vocal tract, which the glottal signal is filtered through.\citeneeded With a given vocal tract filter the direct problem is \emph{given a glottal excitation signal, create the vowel sound}. The inverse problem is \emph{given a (recorded) vowel sound, find the glottal excitation signal}. In this study we will be concentrating on the inverse problem, starting with both a simulated vowel and a real recording.

The inversion from a vowel sound to the glottal signal is an important part of creating synthetic human voices and speech generators. To create a synthetic vowel both the glottal signal and the vocal tract filter are needed. However, the glottal signal cannot be directly measured, but it can be approximated with inversion of a recorded vowel. With this data models for simulating the glottal excitation signal can be created.

\section{Materials and Methods}\label{sec:methods}

\subsection{Glottal excitation signal}
\label{sec:rk}

In this study the Rosenberg-Klatt model (RK-model) for the glottal excitation signal will be used for the generation of synthetic data and as a reference point for the obtained results. The RK-model is a simple model for the glottal signal, proposed in 1970 by Rosenberg.\cite{rosenberg} The model is simple and easy to use, as it creates the signal only from two parameters, the sound frequency $f$ and the so called Klatt-parameter $Q$.

The \emph{airflow} for the glottal excitation signal created by the RK-model is defined as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:RK-model}
g(t) =
  \begin{cases}
   at^2 + bt^3  & \text{jos } 0 \leq t \leq Q T \\
   0            & \text{jos } Q T < t \leq T,
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $t$ is a time variable, $T = 1/f$ is the period of the pitch, $Q \in \left[ 0,1 \right]$ is the Klatt-parameter and $a$ and $b$ are variables defined in terms of $T_0 := QT$ as
\begin{equation*}
a = \frac{27}{4 T_0^2}, \quad b = -\frac{27}{4 T_0^3} .
\end{equation*}
Here the parameter $f$ defines the frequency of the generated signal and the Klatt-parameter $Q$ defines the shape of the pulse.

The glottal excitation signal can be retrieved as the derivative $g'$ of the airflow function. Here $g'$ is the \emph{pressure function}, and simulates the sound generated in the glottis. The pulse generated by the model can be seen in figure \ref{fig:klatt}.

Another, more widely used, model for the glottal excitation signal worth mentioning is the Liljencrants-Fant model (LF-model).\cite{fant} It is regarded as more accurate than the RK-model, but it is also much more complex. It has also been shown, that the LF-model generates only marginally better approximations for the resulting vowel after the vocal tract filtering than the RK-model.\cite{fujisaki} Due to this and the overall complexity of the LF-model we will be using the RK-model for the simulation of the glottal exitation signal in this study.

\subsection{Vocal tract filter}
\label{sec:filter}

In this study we will assume an approximate vocal tract filter to be known for the recorded vowel we want to invert. The digital filter, defined by a vector $a \in \R^{N_a}$, filters the data $x \in \R^n$ as defined by the difference equation
\begin{equation}
\left\{
\begin{alignedat}{1}
\label{eq:filter-diffeq}
y_1     &= x_1 \\
a_1 y_j &= -\sum_{k=2}^{\min\{j-1, N_a\}} a_{k} y_{j-k} ,
\end{alignedat}
\right.
\end{equation}
where $y \in \R^n$ is the filtered data. We denote $y = \varphi_a (x)$.

Consider now the filter defined by $a \in \R^{N_a}$ and the data $x \in \R_n$ which we want to filter. Now the filter defined by \eqref{eq:filter-diffeq} can be expressed by the the matrix $A \in \R^{n \times n}$, where
\begin{equation}
\left\{
\begin{alignedat}{3}
   &A_{1,1}     = a_1 \\
   &A_{i,1}     = - \sum_{k=1}^{\min\{ i-1, N_a-1 \}} a_{k+1} A_{i-k,1}, \quad && 2 \leq i \leq n \\
   &A_{i+1,j+1} = A_{i,j},     && j \leq i \\
   &A_{i,j}     = 0,           && j > i .
\end{alignedat}
\right.
\end{equation}
Now $\varphi_a (x) = Ax$.


\subsection{The matrix model}
\label{sec:matrixModel}

A vowel sound can be simulated by applying a digital filter $A\in\R^{n \times n}$ to a sample of a glottal excitation signal $f \in \R^n$ as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:vow}
v = A f,
\end{equation}
where $v \in \R^n$ is the simulated vowel. In this study we will assume an approximation of the filter $A$ to be known. Given the measurement $m \in \R^n$ of a vowel corresponding approximately to the filter $A$, equation \eqref{eq:vow} can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:vowModel}
m = A f + \eps,
\end{equation}
where $\eps \in \R^n$ denotes the measurement noise.


\subsection{The inversion method}\label{subsec:invMethod}

\subsubsection{Tikhonov reguralization}\label{subsubsec:tikh}
The classical Tikhonov regularized solution for $m = Af + \varepsilon$ defined in (ref here) is usually denoted by the vector $T_\alpha(m)\in\R^n$ that minimizes
\begin{equation*}
\lnorm AT_\alpha(m) - m \rnorm^2 + \alpha \lnorm T_\alpha(m) \rnorm^2 \Leftrightarrow
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
T_\alpha(m) = \underset{z\in\R^n}{\argmin}
\left\{ \lnorm Az - m \rnorm^2 + \alpha \lnorm z \rnorm^2 \right\},
\end{equation*}
where $\alpha > 0$ is called a regularization parameter. The resulting $T_\alpha(m)$ can be understood as a compromise between two conditions, namely
\begin{enumerate}[I.]
 \item $T_\alpha(m)$ should give a small residual $AT_\alpha(m) - m$.
 \item $\lnorm T_\alpha(m) \rnorm_2$ should be small.
\end{enumerate}
The $\alpha$ parameter is used in order to tune to balance between the two conditions above.

In generalized Tikhonov regularization some prior knowledge is assumed to be known. In some cases $f$ might be known to be smooth. This information can be incorporated into the regularization by choosing
\begin{equation}
T_\alpha(m) = \underset{z\in\R^n}{\argmin}
\left\{ \lnorm Az - m \rnorm^2 + \alpha \lnorm Lz \rnorm^2 \right\},
\end{equation}  
where $L$ is a discretized differential operator. In our model proposed in \citeneeded we know the glottal impulse to be zero in an interval [mera kama hit när modellen är skriven]
